# TennisVideowall
Tennis videowall for tracking scores in tennis games.

Originally coded for a friendly doubles match played by Rafa Nadal, John McEnroe, Carlos Moy√† and Simon Solbas on september the 25th of 2016 in the Centre d'Esports Rafa Nadal.

It's plain HTML + Javascript, with heavy aid of the jQuery library. This little snippet of code is intended for standalone and offline use, so everything it's included in here.

The LED screen used had a resolution of 256x384 pixels, vertically oriented (exactly twice as a Spectrum +2A resolution!!), and the projection works via sending the screen, and only the top left corner is on view.

TODO: Allow to change resolution, draw the background vectorially.
